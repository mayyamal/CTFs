- wisdom-alt.c is the vulnerable program 
- wisdom-alt: $ gcc -fno-stack-protector -ggdb -m32 wisdom-alt.c -o wisdom-alt

The program reads data from the stdin and writes to stdout. Typing the number 1 allows you to "receive wisdom" and typing 2 allows you to "add wisdom".
This program is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

To input binary data to the program, use the following command: $./runbin.sh

To exploit the program, you will have to enter sequences of binary bytes that contain addresses, which are 4-byte (i.e., 32-bit) words on the VM. The x86 architecture is "little-endian", meaning that the bytes in a word are stored from least significant to most significant. That means that the hexadecimal address 0xabcdef00 would be entered as individual bytes in reverse order, i.e., \x00\xef\xcd\xab.

To attach gdb to wisdom-alt, you should first invoke ./runbin.sh, and then, in a separate terminal, from the project/1 directory invoke the following line: $ gdb -p `pgrep wisdom-alt`
