# EOF is just some invalid character, so i am passing an invalid hex (\xMM), which will
# trigger EOF immediately.

# Since the user_input[] array is at the same place on the stack as secret[] array was previousely,
# when process_user_input is called, if we exit the loop immediately,
# user_input[] array will be already filled with the string entered previousely in init()
# and strncmp will return 0

python -c 'print("\xMM")' | ./main.elf
