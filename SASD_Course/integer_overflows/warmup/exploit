# unsigned char gets overflown af we pass more than 255 elements in the string
# so i am passing a number of elements which will give value of (>=5 && <12) when doing modulo operation
# my calculation = total = 256+7 = 263 => overflow to 7 which is in the range;
# random characters are in the string except for "1234" on positions 12,13,14,15
