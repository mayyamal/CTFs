# Write your exploit in this file.
# You can change the above shebang to use your preferred interpreter 
# (e.g. python).

#
# HINTS
#
# Here are some simple ways to construct exploit payloads in bash:
#
# Pipe to stdin with newline
# > echo "Hello SASE!" | ./<hacklet.elf>
#
# Pipe stdin without newline
# > echo -n "Hello SASE!" | ./<hacklet.elf>
# > python -c "print('Hello: \x53\x41\x53\x45')" | ./<hacklet.elf>
# 
# To inspect your payload in hex format, you can pipe it into `hd`, e.g.
# > echo "ABCD" | hd
#
