Change the randomization of the code segment
• You should generate two binaries with ASLR enabled
• One binary should have randomization for stack, heap, and code
• The other binary should only have randomization for stack and
heap, but not for code
• Both binaries must run for at least 5 seconds (e.g., sleep(5);
before return) but not longer than 10 seconds
• Test system is Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, kernel 4.4.0-93
