Write a shellcode which outputs SASD2017
• The shellcode must be x86 32bit and ≤ 512 bytes
• It must be alphanumeric, i.e., only contain A-Z, a-z, and 0-9
• It might output anything else as well, as long as “SASD2017” is in the output
• It is also allowed to crash or hang afterwards
• We provide a “framework” to execute your shellcode
